Daniel Bergey
  Daniel Bergey learned to program at his mother’s knee, and has been coding off and on since, usually while he should be doing something else.  He began teaching by showing adults how to double-click on a Mac.  In school he learned to draw straight lines and talk about art.  More recently he’s been using sensors, Python, and graphs to understand the physics and energy use of buildings.  He’s interested in open hardware beyond microelectronics and 3D printers, and in Free software for design.

Christalee Bieber
  Christalee Bieber is a recent transplant to Philadelphia, but she’s jumped right into volunteering at The Hacktory. Her quest is to understand how people learn outside of school, with a particular focus on creative and accessible science education. In her spare time, she enjoys building things out of wood and metal, vegetarian cooking, and brewing; lately she’s been solidifying her knowledge of programming and web design.
