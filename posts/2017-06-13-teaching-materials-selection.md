A few months ago, a former colleague was leading a project where students designed, prototyped, and pitched a model of an urban watershed for use as a teaching tool. They had already interviewed local water department staff and watershed educators, but the instructors were having trouble thinking about how to prepare supplies and activities for prototyping. Materials selection and Ashby charts are rarely covered in depth for most STEM students or teachers, so I suggested a few ways to adapt these topics for high school students:

1. I put a request out to my local network for a maker or engineer who might be available for a visit. An exhibit designer from the city’s science museum took me up on it, and by all accounts it was a great success.

2. Drawings are the quickest way to explore design ideas, so don’t jump immediately to the laser cutter! Students sometimes have a hard time visualizing 3D objects from paper sketches, though, so consider Sketchup or another modeling program for students who are just starting to brainstorm.

3. For supplies, take an hour after school and wander around the building gathering up suitable materials. Anything you can’t find or don’t have enough of, put in an order now. 

Suggestions: plywood, lumber, acrylic sheet, felt/fabric, plastic bottles/containers, metal bars, tile, XPS foam, glass pebbles, PVC pipes, polycarbonate sheet, landscaping/craft foam, aluminum foil, plastic wrap…

Also start gathering scissors, glue guns, box cutters, Gorilla glue, tape, glue sticks, and other tabletop cutting and fastening supplies. Maybe also markers, graph paper, rulers, and boxes to organize everything per classroom and per group.

4. For activity ideas to break down the materials selection process, I pointed them to MIT D-Lab’s excellent Materials Selection poster <https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/D-Lab_Learn-It_Material-selection.pdf>. For these students, I would start by going over the table at the top to get acquainted with the key questions and comparisons between wood, metal, and plastic. Which parts of this chart are relevant to this project? What would you add? Is color or paintability important, or not? Having samples of materials on hand can help demonstrate differences in weight, strength, absorption, etc. and spark creativity. 

Next, to ground it in the logistics of the fabrication shop, students can make a list of machines and the materials each one can cut or join. Add notes on how much time/effort is involved in each method; the entire 10th grade probably can’t design and laser cut multiple iterations in a week. Students may realize they need to improve their CAD skills or get trained on a machine - now is the time to start!

Step back and refer to your exploration of what properties are most important for the prototype and the final product (remember, they may not be the same!) A model you hope to manufacture in bulk as a teaching aid might need to be light, strong, cheap, and waterproof. What combination of materials and manufacturing techniques can accomplish that? You may need to try something out, like comparing the behavior of plywood vs. lumber in water, or do more research, like finding out exactly which plastics can be cut safely on the laser cutter.

By the time your prototype is built, your analysis should show why you chose the materials and manufacturing methods you did. It can also form the basis of your recommendations on how the final product should be produced, although design for manufacturing is a whole topic on its own. **

Note: I also highly recommend D-Lab’s companion Learn-It resources, Adhesives <https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/D-Lab_Learn-It_Adhesives.pdf> and Fasteners <https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/D-Lab_Learn-It_Fasteners_0.pdf>
