A few months ago, a former colleague lead a project where students designed, prototyped, and pitched a model of an urban watershed for use as a teaching tool. They had already interviewed local water department staff and watershed educators, and now the instructors contacted me as they thought about supplies and activities for prototyping. Materials selection and Ashby charts are rarely covered in depth for most STEM students or teachers, so I enjoyed this unusual request. Here's my advice:

1. Find a maker or engineer who might be available for a visit. I put a call out and got a response from an exhibit designer at the city’s science museum.

2. Drawings are the quickest way to explore design ideas, so don’t jump immediately to the laser cutter! In addition to 2D paper sketches, onsider Sketchup or another modeling program to build 3D visualization skills, especially for younger students. 

3. Essential questions: What is the timeline? budget? What concepts or lessons is this model trying to teach? What goals does it serve? What functions or properties does it need to do that?

Ideally students would come up with these questions, and some of their answers, during the project introduction. Write them down for easy reference. To  they should think about the 5 Ws: Who will use this? When? Where? To do what? Why? 
Have them fill in the blank: This model needs to be ________ (cheap, durable, easy to build, easy to fix, fixable without special tools, expandable/upgradable, waterproof, easy to clean, not too heavy, collapsible, creative?)

3. Grab some boxes and take an hour after school gathering up prototyping materials: plywood, lumber, acrylic sheet, felt/fabric, plastic bottles/containers, metal bars, tile, XPS foam, glass pebbles, PVC pipes, polycarbonate sheet, landscaping/craft foam, aluminum foil, plastic wrap... Also gather scissors, glue guns, box cutters, Gorilla glue, tape, glue sticks, and other tabletop cutting and fastening supplies. Maybe also markers, graph paper, and rulers. Use the boxes to organize everything per classroom and per group. Anything you can’t find or don’t have enough of, put in an order now!

4. For pointers on how to break down the materials selection process, I recommend MIT D-Lab’s excellent [Materials Selection poster](https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/D-Lab_Learn-It_Material-selection.pdf) (They also have resources on [Adhesives](https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/D-Lab_Learn-It_Adhesives.pdf) and [Fasteners](https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/D-Lab_Learn-It_Fasteners_0.pdf).

Ask students to look at the table at the top to get acquainted with the key questions and comparisons between wood, metal, and plastic. Which parts of this chart are relevant to this project? What would you add? Is color or paintability important, or not? Having samples of materials on hand can help demonstrate differences in weight, strength, absorption, etc. and get ideas flowing.

Next, to ground it in the logistics of the fabrication shop, students can make a list of machines and the materials each one can cut or join. Add notes on how much time/effort is involved in each method; the entire 10th grade probably can’t design and laser cut multiple iterations in a week. Students may realize they need to improve their CAD skills or get trained on a machine - now is the time to schedule some tutorials!

Step back and refer to your exploration of what properties are most important for the prototype and the final product (remember, they may not be the same!) A model you hope to manufacture in bulk as a teaching aid might need to be light, strong, cheap, and waterproof. What combination of materials and manufacturing techniques can accomplish that? You may need to try something out, like comparing the behavior of plywood vs. lumber in water, or do more research, like finding out exactly which plastics can be cut safely on the laser cutter.

By the time your prototype is built, your analysis should show why you chose the materials and manufacturing methods you did. It can also form the basis of your recommendations on how the final product should be produced, although design for manufacturing is a whole topic on its own. Congratulations: 


Workshop 10th Grade (3/4) Watershed Model Project
- need a “maker mentor” to show up for a day (? 1 day per advisory? 2 project blocks?) to provide expertise on techniques & materials and general designing
- Task: redesign a watershed model that Philly WaterWorks can use for education (prototype and final) -> production

- constraints: deadlines; shop capabilities; shop capacity (~60 students, in 18 groups);
- It’s hard to brainstorm about materials & tools you’re not super familiar with - how to structure/stimulate exploration?

- Look over project documentation, summarize into a para? Get back to Katrina et al. by noon tomorrow (2/15)

Important considerations (how to get students to come up with these? and then answer them?):
- What is the timeline? budget?
- What concepts or lessons is this model trying to teach? What goals does it serve?
- What functions or properties does it need to do that?

- Who will use it? When? Where? To do what? How? Why?
- Fill in the blank: This model needs to be _________
