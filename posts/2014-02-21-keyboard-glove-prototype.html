<p>Around 1999, I read Gershenfeld’s <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EU0Fh97hmksC&amp;printsec=frontcover">When Things Start to Think</a></em>, and got excited about wearable computers. I’ve been waiting for a mass-market chording keyboard ever since. In the meantime, wearable computers have become ubiquitous, and we’re starting to see heads-up displays. I’ve listened as small talk has gone from “how do the kids type with their thumbs on these cell phones” to “have you installed swype?” And I’m still waiting for a wearable keyboard, one that’s built into a glove, and lets me touch-type on any hard surface.</p>
<p>I tried to build one once (2004?). I knew almost nothing about electronics, PIC microcontrollers were a pain to program, especially on a student budget, and it wasn’t clear where to get soft buttons outside of the Media Lab. But all that’s changed. Arduino and AVRs are a lot easier to work with, and recent Arduino’s speak USB HID (mouse and keyboard protocol) out of the box. Sparkfun sells Leah Buechley’s sewable Arduinos, and a range of compatible materials. Adafruit has their own line, and lots of tutorials. And sometime in the last 5 years, more or less by accident, I’ve learned enough about Arduinos and op-amps and working with conductive thread to try again.</p>

<p>So I finally have a wearable keyboard - though right now it only types lowercase letters. The sensor on each finger is made from a piece of velostat sandwiched between two pieces of woven conductive fabric.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2014-02-21-keyboard-glove-thumb-closeup.jpg" /></p>
<p>The resistance of the velostat drops with increasing pressure. I’m worried that the resistance of sensors made this way will vary too much from one to the next, but 4 out of 5 I’ve made so far acceptably consistent—above 20 kΩ unpressed, below 2 kΩ pressed. I’m pretty sure the problem with the first one is that the thumb of the glove pictured already had conductive fibers for touchscreen use. I have them wired to the analog inputs of the Arduino, which is a bit of a waste. If I want to add more sensors, I’ll need to switch to an external comparitor or a different button design. For now, the analog inputs make for easy debugging.</p>
<p>There are variations I’d like to try. Using two gloves would make more characters easy to type, and many more available in total. I think that with a flex sensor on each finger, I could read at least two “keys”, again increasing the available keys, though not as much. I want to build a couple more of this first design, and get more practice typing with it, before I start those experiments.</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="https://github.com/bergey/handwriting">the code is on github</a>.</p>
