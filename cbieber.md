Christalee is a recent transplant to Philadelphia, but she’s jumped right into volunteering at The Hacktory. Her quest is to understand how people learn outside of school, with a particular focus on creative and accessible science education. In her spare time, she enjoys building things out of wood and metal, vegetarian cooking, and brewing; lately she’s been solidifying her knowledge of programming and web design.
